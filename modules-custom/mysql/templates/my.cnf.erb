# You can copy this to one of:

# - "~/.my.cnf" to set user-specific options.

# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.

# For explanations see

# It has been reported that passwords should be enclosed with ticks/quotes
# escpecially if they contain "#" chars...
